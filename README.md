# MATH60210 Financial Econometrics Labs

**Note: Consider this as an ongoing project for future purposes. Not intended to be published in its actual state.**

## Abstract 

This course presents the main econometric methods in finance. Topics covered include asset pricing models, financial time series prediction, model estimation, risk and volatility modeling, and event studies.

This course is divided into four blocks. The first block covers a review of the main asset pricing models and presents advanced methods for empirically testing these models. The second block covers the prediction of financial time series, the numerical implementation of AR and VAR models and non-linear estimation (probit, logit, and NLLS). Forecast evaluation is also covered. The third block covers advanced techniques in financial risk modeling, estimation of financial models with numerical optimization (ML and QML) and volatility modeling with GARCH models. The last block covers event studies and penalized linear models (LASSO, Ridge, and ElasticNet).

These labs were developed as a showcase for adequate practice to help students complete their assignments. Each of them were thought in 3 hours session by myself as part of MATH60210:A2022 and MATH60210:H2023.
